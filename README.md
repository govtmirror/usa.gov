# About this Repository
The goal of this feedback repository is to facilitate a conversation about how to improve the USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov beta websites. Source code will not be located here (although we’re exploring putting more of our code out on GitHub). 

# What’s New at USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov?
On April 29, 2015, we launched a preview of the future of USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov at [beta.USA.gov](http://beta.usa.gov) and [beta.Gobierno.USA.gov](http://beta.gobierno.usa.gov), respectively.  The goals of the beta websites are to:
* Make the content more useful and easier to find.
* Make sure you get the same information via the web or phone at 1-844-USA-GOV1 (1‑844‑872‑4681).
* Make all of the content available via APIs so that it can be re-used by developers. The APIs aren't ready quite yet, but we’ll update this repository when they’re available.

If you’re interested, you can learn more [about USA.gov](http://beta.usa.gov/about).

# How To Join The Conversation
Joining the conversation is easy. Just use the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/usagov/usa.gov/issues) for this repository and create new new issues or contribute your thoughts to existing issues to provide feedback. We’ll add items as we work to make the beta websites even better, describing changes we’re making and why.

## A Few Simple Rules
We want this conversation to be useful and interesting, so to help facilitate that, we ask that you keep your comments related to the websites and:
* **Be respectful**. Personal attacks, profanity, and aggressive behavior are prohibited. So are name-calling and starting hostile, disrespectful arguments.
* **Don’t spam**. Repeated posting of identical or very similar content in way that’s counterproductive to an engaged, participatory exchange of ideas is prohibited. This includes comments that aggressively promote services or products.
* **Don’t share personally identifiable information**. Don’t share things like your phone number, home address,or other sensitive information that could compromise your identity or privacy.

We welcome open and honest conversation, but we will close and lock an issue if it violates these principles.
